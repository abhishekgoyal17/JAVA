Factory Pattern:

The KeyValueStoreFactory class abstracts the creation of different types of KeyValueStore. It allows the application to choose the persistence strategy (e.g., file-based or in-memory) based on the configuration or user input.
Singleton Pattern:

The PersistentKeyValueStore class uses the Singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance of the key-value store is created. This helps avoid conflicts when interacting with the file system or database.
Strategy Pattern:

The PersistenceStrategy interface allows you to define various strategies for storing and retrieving data (e.g., file-based, in-memory). By using the Strategy pattern, you can easily extend the application to support additional persistence mechanisms (such as a NoSQL database).
Encapsulation:

The internal workings of the PersistentKeyValueStore (such as file handling, serialization, and data storage) are encapsulated in the PersistentKeyValueStore class, which provides a clean and simple API for interacting with the store.
Extensibility:

The design is easily extensible. You can add more persistence strategies (e.g., cloud storage or a relational database) by implementing the PersistenceStrategy interface without modifying the core PersistentKeyValueStore class.
